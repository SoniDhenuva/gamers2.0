    subtitle: "Navigating Time in Code: From Errors to Understanding"
    description: "An educational platform that helps CS newcomers build mental models for temporal problem-solving in software development. Through interactive lessons, learners explore how to trace make errors back to their source, understand the timeline of merge conflicts, and develop systematic debugging approaches. Each lesson uses temporal wayfinding principles — helping students understand not just what went wrong, but when and why, building crucial skills for navigating codebases and version control systems with confidence."

    subtitle: "Structured Pathways to Development Mastery"
    description: "Six comprehensive learning modules designed to build temporal reasoning skills essential for modern software development. Each module combines theory, interactive exercises, and real-world scenarios. Learners progress from understanding single errors to managing complex multi-file conflicts, developing systematic approaches that transfer across languages and tools. Built-in checkpoints ensure understanding before advancement, while branching scenarios let learners explore consequences of different resolution strategies."
