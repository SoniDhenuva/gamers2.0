## Video Script Table

| Step | Time | % | Talking Points | Notes & Actions |
|------|------|---|----------------|-----------------|
| **1. Introduction & Navigation** | 0:00-0:45 | 5% | "Welcome to the OCS GameEngine module, designed to reduce cognitive load when learning object-based programming. This module serves 9th-10th grade students in weeks 13-24 of their course. Let me show you the infoGraph navigation system that organizes the entire learning experience." | - Login to site<br>- Navigate to `/game/guide` permalink<br>- Show infoGraph with 3 cards visible<br>- Emphasize visual organization |
| **2. GameEngine Briefing** | 0:45-2:00 | 10% | "The first component is the GameEngine Briefing, which introduces core architecture and mechanics. Students learn about the game loop, object lifecycle, sprite animations, and collision interactions. Notice the key points: Game Objects, Game Loop, Properties and Updates, Interactions and Reactions. This provides the conceptual foundation before students begin authoring." | - Click GameEngine Briefing card<br>- Scroll through intro content<br>- Point out sprite animation gif<br>- Show systems thinking diagram<br>- **Highlight multimedia integration** (animations, images) |
| **3A. GameBuilder - Authoring View** | 2:00-3:30 | 15% | "Now we enter GameBuilder, the **rapid authoring tool** that reduces cognitive load. This is where instructional design meets implementation. Students configure game objects visually without writing syntax. Let me demonstrate: I'll select a background image from our asset library, add a player sprite, configure an NPC, and set up barriers. Notice how the interface provides immediate visual feedback—this is the authoring view." | - Click GameBuilder card<br>- Show file browser for `/images/gamebuilder/`<br>- Select background image<br>- Add player sprite with animation frames<br>- Configure NPC properties (speed, behavior)<br>- Add barrier objects<br>- **Emphasize this is the e-learning development tool**<br>- Mention asset library as multimedia resources |
| **3B. GameBuilder - Code Generation** | 3:30-4:30 | 10% | "When students click 'Generate Code,' GameBuilder creates structured JavaScript that imports from our essentials library. This is the bridge between visual design and code implementation. The generated code shows proper object initialization, property configuration, and imports. Students can then test immediately using our local development environment with the `make dev` command." | - Click "Generate Code" button<br>- Show generated `GameLevelCustom.js` code<br>- Point out imports from essentials/<br>- Highlight object configuration structure<br>- Run `make dev` in terminal<br>- Show live game running |
| **3C. GameBuilder - Learner View** | 4:30-5:15 | 8% | "Here's the learner outcome—the game running with sprite animations, collision detection, and interactive behaviors. Students see immediate results from their configuration work. This is the learner view: a functioning game that demonstrates object-based mechanics in action. The visual-to-code-to-runtime pipeline keeps cognitive load manageable." | - Show running game in browser<br>- Demonstrate player movement<br>- Show NPC interactions<br>- Trigger collision with barrier<br>- Point out sprite animations in motion<br>- **Multimedia demonstration** (audio if present) |
| **3D. Formative Assessments Connection** | 5:15-6:15 | 10% | "GameBuilder directly supports our **three Formative Assessments**: Formative 1 requires configuring foundational objects—background, player, NPC, barrier. Formative 2 adds interaction logic and reactions. Formative 3 focuses on asset management and file structure. Students document their progress in GitHub Issues with screenshots showing their GameBuilder work and running games. This is how the authoring tool connects to assessment tracking." | - Split screen: GameBuilder + Assessment guide<br>- Read FA1, FA2, FA3 objectives<br>- Show example GitHub Issue with screenshots<br>- Point out assessment structure: **3 Formative + 1 Summative**<br>- Emphasize tools = evidence of learning |
| **4. Logistics & Submission Guide** | 6:15-7:15 | 10% | "The Logistics guide is the bridge from authoring to assessment workflow. Students use **GitHub as the LMS and assessment tracking system**—it provides version control, team collaboration via Kanban boards, Issue tracking for progress documentation, and Pull Request workflows for code review. This unified platform serves both student development and instructor assessment. The screenshots show example Kanban organization and Issue documentation that students should emulate. Notice the video callout: students must capture GameBuilder screenshots, running game evidence, and commit links for their Summative video." | - Navigate to Logistics guide<br>- Show Team Repo setup section<br>- Scroll to Kanban screenshot with caption<br>- Show Issue screenshot with caption<br>- Point out video evidence callout<br>- Emphasize GitHub = unified tool for authoring & assessment<br>- Show VSCode Dev Setup section |
| **5. Summative Assessment Review** | 7:15-8:30 | 13% | "The **Summative Assessment** integrates all three Formative tasks into a team project. Students must: integrate individual levels, demonstrate interactions in a video walkthrough, contribute best assets via Pull Request, write a 150-word reflection on applying object-based mechanics, and show complete GitHub documentation. This capstone assessment demonstrates mastery while maintaining structured workflow practices. The assessment structure is clearly visible: FA1 objects become team levels, FA2 interactions are shown in video, FA3 asset management contributes to the shared library." | - Navigate back to main guide<br>- Show Assessment Structure callout at top<br>- Scroll to Summative section<br>- Read key requirements aloud<br>- Point out connection to 3 Formatives<br>- Highlight: narrative reflection, video demo, team PR<br>- Show Review Criteria list |
| **6. Conclusion & Research Goal** | 8:30-9:00 | 7% | "This module demonstrates design-based research on reducing cognitive overload through visual authoring tools. GameBuilder serves as the rapid development environment, GitHub provides the LMS infrastructure, and the three Formative assessments scaffold learning toward the Summative integration. Students apply object-based programming concepts within a larger system while developing professional workflow practices. Thank you." | - Return to infoGraph view showing all 3 cards<br>- Emphasize cognitive load reduction goal<br>- Note dual purpose: student learning + research evidence<br>- Final frame on Assessment Structure |

## Speaking Tips

- **Pacing:** Speak slightly slower than normal for clarity
- **Emphasis:** Use phrases like "notice how," "this demonstrates," "the key here is"
- **Academic tone:** Balance technical accuracy with accessibility
- **Tool names:** Always use full names first mention (e.g., "GameBuilder, our rapid authoring tool")
- **Requirements:** Explicitly state when covering requirement areas (e.g., "This demonstrates the multimedia integration requirement")
