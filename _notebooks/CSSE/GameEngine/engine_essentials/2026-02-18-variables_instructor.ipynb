    "\n",
    "When you create (declare) a variable in JavaScript, you usually use either `let` or `const`:\n",
    "- Use `let` when you want to create a variable that can change (mutable). For example, a player's score or health, which may go up or down during the game.\n",

    "## HTML Variables and the DOM\n",
    "\n",
    "One of JavaScript’s primary roles is interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) — the structured representation of a web page. Every HTML element on the page is an object. When you write JavaScript for a website, you are working with those objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding and Using References\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify an element, you first store a reference to it using methods like `getElementById()` or `querySelector()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have that reference, you can read or change its properties — just like any other object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dot Notation and Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting an element, you use dot notation to modify its properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const button = document.getElementById('my-btn'); // Get a reference to the button element\n",
    "button.style.backgroundColor = 'blue'; // Change the background color\n",
    "button.textContent = 'Clicked!'; // Change the button text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This follows the exact same pattern you use in game objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const player = { name: 'Mario', score: 100 };\n",
    "player.score += 10; // Update the score property\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "If you understand objects, you understand the DOM.\n",
    "Web development is simply applying object manipulation to elements on a page.\n",
